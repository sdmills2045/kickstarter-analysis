# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The basis of this project is a dataset of productions over about an eight-year period between 2009 and 2017. Specifically, the data set relates to fund raising for productions in the category of plays.
### Purpose

Each play receives contributions from backers of fundraising campaigns. We would like to analyze the dataset in order to create a report for our client, Louise. The goal is to identify the level of fundraising success between the launch date and the deadline. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion is that May has the best outcomes. The campaigns during the warm weather months are more successful. I also notice a small spike again in October. It seems that outcomes spike at the seasonal change for spring and fall.
The second conclusion is that campaigns fail 58% of the time. Although this number is not on the chart it is easy to calculate. I would be interested to know how this translates in monetary value.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The results of this chart are bit more difficult to draw conclusions. The chart reports data that does not necessarily mean anything unless you know more information and background about the plays. This data would be more valuable when translated to a monetary value.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenge for me was making sure to answer the question that is asked. The formula I set up originally did not take into consideration a filter for plays. I can see the importance of making sure to answer the question with the correct data.
A second challenge for me was dealing with the percentages. While it appears that my numbers are correct, my labeling is not. I did move on from this issue without a resolution so that I could submit my assignment on time.
## Results

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset does not give demographics. Who are the backers, what is their income? What are the genres of the plays? Did some genres perform better than others? Are some of the plays in a foreign language? Was the success or failure of foreign language plays consistent with the demographics of the area?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A chart could be created to compare the success of plays depending on the country. This could identify if any theatres are underperforming. 
A chart giving a visual to the monetary value of the campaign would be useful. At the end of the day, the actual amount spent is a key factor in decision making.
